*Summary*
If you have GU10 or MR16 halogen bulbs in your house, now is the time to replace them. Read on for information on what options you have and advice on which bulbs to get and where to get them from&mdash;at a discount.

  <p>
    Our favourite GU10 bulb&mdash;the Maxilux&mdash;is on the the far right and at centre. If you want to stick with old-style 2-pin fittings with temperamental 12V transformers, then the slightly noisy and expensive Philips Master LEDspot (fourth from the left) might be the one to go for.

*A bit of background*
Standard MR16 halogen reflector light bulbs (with a GU5.3 base) require a 12V supply, supplied through a transformer. They are popular because they produce a good quality of light without taking up a lot of space.

GU10 halogen bulbs have, since their introduction in the 1990s, offered an alternative light source that does not require a separate transformer. A GU10 halogen bulb is more convenient, but it is also  less efficient than a 12V reflector and the light quality is generally not as good.

In our house we had, until this month, a combined total of eighteen GU5.3 recessed fittings in the kitchen, bathroom and hallway, and six GU10 fittings in various ceiling lights in bedrooms. The combined output from these 24 lights, which each took a 50W bulb, was 1,200kW, costing about 20p per hour.

*Swapping to LEDs*
The introduction of LED lighting does somewhat change the relative benefits of the different types of reflector bulbs. There is now no material difference in the quality of light output from the two different kinds of bulbs or in their energy consumption. The difference between the two kinds of bulb continues to be that the electronics to convert the power supply to low-voltage is contained in the base of the GU10 bulb, whereas GU5.3 bulbs use a separate transformer.

But many existing transformers will not work with low-power LED bulbs. This means that for replacing existing halogen MR16 bulbs there are generally three choices: choose more expensive LED bulbs capable of working with existing transformers; replace existing transformers with new transformers capable of working at low currents; or remove the transformers altogether and switch to GU10 bulbs.

Furthermore, some LED bulbs are slightly longer and wider than their halogen equivalents, so they will not necessarily be compatible with existing fixtures. Replacing or removing the transformers needed for 12V MR16s is a simple and relatively inexpensive job, but replacing an entire downlight housing is likely to be more costly. 

In our case, several 12V LED bulbs acquired at different times over the last year or so have proved to be either too large for our existing recessed light fittings or incompatible with our existing transformers. The only bulb we found that worked with all our transformers was the Philips Master LEDspot, but its integrated cooling fan produces an audible whine which makes it less than ideal.

*Conclusion*
We could have replaced our existing transformers relatively cheaply, but in the end, decided to have them removed and the old GU5.3 sockets replaced with GU10 sockets running straight off the mains (except in the bathroom, where we decided to keep the existing 12V supply for safety reasons).

We went for a lesser-known brand called Maxilux, except in the bathroom where we used 10W GU5.3 Philips Master LEDspots. The Maxilux was the only GU10 LED bulb we could find that was powerful enough to replace our 50W halogen bulbs, small enough to fit in the existing fixtures, and dimmable. They also had the best quality of light output, provided by a Sharp LED COB ("chip-on-board") module. This technology will soon be widespread, but the Maxilux is one of the first on the market. The Philips Master, while it uses more conventional surface-mounted LEDs, clearly uses some very sophisticated electronics to be able to cope with almost any old 12V transformer without any noticeable flicker (shame about the price and the noise from the cooling fan).

Our halogen bulbs have now all been replaced with LEDs with a combined output of less than 100W, costing a total of around 2p per hour, with no significant loss of light output. If each light is used on average for six hours per day, then the saving will be about £400 per year&mdash;or £16 per bulb&mdash;with a payback period of about 9 months or so and an expected life of 10-15 years.

If we had needed more light output, then we might have been tempted to wait a few months for higher-powered COB LEDs to become available, but we have got used to the somewhat faded light of our old halogens bulbs. LED bulbs in the 7-10W range&mdash;which are sometimes advertised as equivalent to 50W halogens&mdash;are actually significantly brighter than a halogen light after a few hundred hours of use and would be too bright for our needs.

We chose dimmable Maxilux Zenigata 4.5W Cool White GU10 bulbs with Sharp 3.6W Zenigata LEDs, supplied by <a href="http://www.yourwelcome.co.uk">yourwelcome.co.uk</a>. These bulbs are also available in a "warm white" colour and also with a GU5.3 base (for which you may also require new transformers).

*Recommendations*
If you already have halogen lights with GU10 fittings, you are definitely in luck: go out and get replacement LED bulbs now. 

If, on the other hand, you have traditional 12V MR16s, then proceed with caution. There are many alternative LED replacements to choose from, but you will not know if they are compatible with your existing transformers until you try them.

Consider investing in one of the newer "COB" LEDs. They are not much more expensive and the light distribution is generally better than the surface-mounted LEDs used in older models&mdash;although your choices may be limited if your existing lights use an incompatible 12V transformer.

Be aware that LEDs do not all produce the same colour of light. The usual descriptions used to generalise these differences are "cool white" and "warm white", although different bulbs will render subtly different colours within this range. Make sure you like the colour rendering of your chosen bulb before making a major investment.

If you are part of the Energy Challenge and you would like to order some of the Maxilux bulbs, we have negotiated a discount with the supplier. Please contact us for details.

If you are having problems working out which 12V MR16 LED to go for, we have a selection that you can try out. Please contact us for details.
